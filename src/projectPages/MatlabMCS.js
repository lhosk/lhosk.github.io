            tools: matlab, monte carlo simulation, random sampling, 
            2d and 3d geometry, spatial estimation, numerical methods
            
            this was my first time coding and it was for a computational physics class (matlab based)
            the problem is to estimate the area of a circle using a monte carlo simulation

            this class was the beginning of computer science for me and the projectâ€™s development shows
            the given problem is just 2D with one circle and given bounds

            later, i would update this to include multiple circles
            then, i would add holes to the program
            (allows user to predict area of the circles - area of hole)

            once i was done with the 2d version, i turned it into a 3d problem
            so, i updated it with spheres and spherical holes

            lastly, i updated it to work with ellipses

            one of the outputs can be found below:
            (pink is the sphere we are measure and black is a "spherical hole")
          `
            .trim()
            .split('\n')
            .map((line, i) => (
              <p
                key={i}
                style={{
                  margin: line.trim() === '' ? '0.5rem 0' : '0.3rem 0',
                  lineHeight: '1.4',
                }}
              >
                {line.trim() === '' ? '\u00A0' : line.trim()}
              </p>
            ))}
