          this was my first time coding and it was for a computational physics class (matlab based)
          the problem is to estimate the area of a circle using a monte carlo simulation

          this class was the beginning of computer science for me and the projectâ€™s development shows this
          the given problem is just 2D with one circle and given bounds

          later, i would update this to include multiple circles
          then, i would add holes to the program
          this allows the user to predict the area of the circles, while taking away the hole occupied areas

          once i was done with the 2d version, i turned it into a 3d problem
          so, i updated it with spheres and spherical holes

          lastly, i updated it to work with ellipses

          one of the outputs can be found below:
          (pink is the sphere we are measure and black is a "spherical hole")
        `
          .trim()
          .split('\n')
          .map((line, i) => (
            <p
              key={i}
              style={{
                margin: line.trim() === '' ? '0.5rem 0' : '0.3rem 0',
                lineHeight: '1.4',
              }}
            >
              {line.trim() === '' ? '\u00A0' : line.trim()}
            </p>
